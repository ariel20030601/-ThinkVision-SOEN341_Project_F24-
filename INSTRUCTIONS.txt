INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO SET UP SPRINT 1

1) Make sure to have XAMPP and node.js installed

2) Extract the zip file and open the folder in your desired editor (Visual Studio Code was primarily used for this sprint)

3) Open XAMPP and start MySQL and Apache

4) In MySQL, create a database called "pas"

5) In the command line enter npm install to install the needed node_modules

(IMPORTANT! If the previous step fails, attempt to reconfigure the directory by doing the following:
    - Copy the path of the directory, that is right click on the Sprint 1 folder and click copy path
    - In the command line, type: Set-Loaction "..." , where ... are the copied path

6) Type npm start or node server.js
(Should say in the command line "Server running on port 5000" (It is port 5002) and "MySQL database connected")

7) Enter "localhost:5002" in your desired browser (currently tested on firefox and chrome)
