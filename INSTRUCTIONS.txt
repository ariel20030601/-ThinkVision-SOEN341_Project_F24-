*** INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO RUN THE APP ***

    1) Make sure to have XAMPP and Node.js installed

    2) Clone the remote repo, two main ways:
        (a) Extracting the zip file on your chosen directory
        (b) Or through the command line, from your chosen directory execute: 
            git clone https://github.com/soen341ThinkVision/-ThinkVision-SOEN341_Project_F24-.git

    3) Open the folder in your editor (Visual Studio Code has been mainly used so far)

    4) Open XAMPP and start MySQL and Apache

    5) In MySQL (I recommend Workbench for an easy MySQL interface) create a database called "pas"

    6) In the command line, cd into the folder of the current sprint, and to install the necessary
        packages execute: npm install

        *IMPORTANT!* If the previous step fails, try to reconfigure the directory by doing the following:
            - Copy the directory path, that is, right click on the Sprint folder and click 'copy path',
            - Then in the command line, run: Set-Location <copied path>

    7) To launch the server, execute from the command line either npm start or node server.js
        - It should log to console "Server running on port 5002" and "MySQL database connected"

    8) Then to use the app enter "localhost:5002" in your browser (currently tested on firefox & chrome)

*** IMPORTANT OBSERVATIONS ***

    - Whenever the server is reloaded, the database is cleared and the tables are reset, if you'd
        like to disable that while testing new features, just comment out lines 44-61 of server.js,
        but then you must set up the teachers and students table yourself in your local database.

    - When a professor user uploads a .csv file with the course roster, the file must be formatted 
        as follows: first column labeled "ID" and second column labeled "Name".
        - See test.csv for a simple example.
